A tiny Django app to do stand-alone email confirmation with no users,
no dependencies, just an object that has an email address.

1. Stick emailconfirmation in your INSTALLED_APPS.

2. Add (r'^', include('emailconfirmation.urls')) to your urls.py.

3. Anywhere you want an object that has an email field to be confirmed via
   email, say just after it's been created, simply call:
       EmailConfirmation.objects.confirm(request, object, page_after)
   and return a "Please check your email" page.
   'page_after' should be the name of a URL that we will redirect to after
   successful confirmation, and should have (\d+) somewhere in the URL where
   the ID of the confirmed object will go.

Override emailconfirmation/email.txt to supply your own confirmation email.
'object' will refer to the object being confirmed.
